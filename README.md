The The Copernicus Climate Change Service - [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) (C3S-CDS) is a single point of free and open access to a wide range of quality-assured climate datasets distributed in the cloud, provided as part of the EU's Copernicus Earth Observation Programme. CDS datasets include observations and historical climate data records for dealing with climate impact in different industrial sectors, including energy, water management and agriculture. It can be also used to access CMIP6 data in the regional and global scale. Apart from its web-based toolbox, data can also be retrieved using its [Python API (cdsapi)](https://pypi.org/project/cdsapi/).

This repo aims to share with public users the use of cdsapi which can be used to retrieve diverse climate data sets. The notebooks illustrates demo to retrieve CMIP6 rainfall data, as well as some first steps for data exploration.

## Example Data:
## Rainfall seasonal patterns in California derived from the weather station, retrieved via cdsapi.
